This repository contains capstone projects created for Hyperion Dev. It currently contains 2 programs:

1. finance_calculators.py
2. minesweeper.py


1. Finance calculator

This program calculates either the amount of interest accrued on an amount for repayment on a house bond. The user inputs which option they would like via text in the terminal and is then prompted to provide the necessary figures. 

It is written in Python and can be downloaded and run on any machine supporting Python.

2. Minesweeper

This program converts a 2D array into a format that displays the proximity to a 'mine' like the minesweeper game. The intial 2D array is given in the minefield variable. The characters '-' representing a free space, and the '#' representing a mine. It will then work through the array, identify the spaces in proximity to the mines and count how many mines are adjacent. It will return a 2D array in matrix format with the mines left as '#' and a number of mines in the vicinity. 

It is written in Python and can be downloaded and run on any machine supporting Python.

The original 2D array:
